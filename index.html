            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In May I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from
                    the University of Texas at Dallas.
                </p>
                <p>As a computer engineer, I have knowledge in both computer
                    science and programming, as well
                    as electronic circuits and many of their applications. I am
                    currently focusing on finding a career related to computer
                    science, but topics like embedded systems are also very
                    interesting to me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is entirely created and hosted by myself. I
                    developed the site using HTML and CSS, and am hosting it
                    through the use of Docker containers and Cloudflare. I
                    created it to learn more about web development and am
                    currently working on learning JavaScript and its many
                    popular frameworks so I can improve it futher.
                </p>

                    resume and other links to stay connected.
